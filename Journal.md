# **Machine Lab - Ali's Jounral**

## Thursday - 22 Jan
For the first assignment of this course, we were required to construct a cardboard crane, which had a servo 'sweeping' the arm of the crane. However, for my submission, I decided to implement 'Knob' functionality instead. This way, rather than automatic movement, using a potentiometer, the arm of the crane can be moved with both direction maped according to Knob and it's input.
